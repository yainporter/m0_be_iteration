# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
It's very useful when you have a list of arracys that you need to repeat, but you want to put specific methods on what is repeated.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
I just need to get used to using the correct syntax for the `each` method. It just takes practice.
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
It helps to have the browser up with the lesson so that I can go back and reference code when I need it.
